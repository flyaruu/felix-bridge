I created this project to embed an OSGi runtime into a Servlet 3.0 application server.

I've tried Equinox first, but there were several explicit dependencies to Servlet 2.x packages.
Felix was much easier, but still it took me quite some fooling around (the samples on Felix's site
aren't completely up to date with the latest Felix version) so I hope this saves some people some
time.
